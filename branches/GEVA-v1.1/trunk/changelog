v1.1 18 february 2009
	v1.1 is a bug fix release which updates the code for the Santa Fe
	Ant Trail example problem. Edited the trail so move, right and
	left can only be done if there is energy left Changed the facing
	of the ant in the start position to East(x=0,y=1) instead of
	South(x=1,y=0) Changed left to right and right to left. Thanks to
	Bill Teahan and Loukas Georgiou for highlighting the ant starting
	position and left/right bugs.
